= Handwritten Note Scanner App

An Android application for scanning handwritten notes and converting them to digital text format using OCR technology.

== Project Overview

This is a hobby project to create an Android app that can:

* Capture images of handwritten notes using the device camera
* Process the images using OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
* Extract and digitize handwritten text
* Export the recognized text to various file formats
* Provide a user-friendly interface for managing scanned notes
